# Spotify Clone

Welcome to the **Spotify Clone** repository! This project aims to replicate the basic functionality of the Spotify music player. It includes a simple user interface
with a song list, play/pause functionality, and song progress control.

## HTML Structure

The HTML file (`index.html`) defines the structure of the Spotify Clone. It includes a navigation bar, a container for the song list, a banner for the currently playing song,
and a bottom section containing playback controls and song information. The page uses external styles from `style.css` and incorporates Font Awesome icons.

## CSS Styles

The styles in `style.css` are designed to create an appealing and user-friendly interface. It includes styling for the navigation bar, song list, container, 
and bottom playback controls. The background image and color scheme aim to enhance the overall visual experience.

## JavaScript Functionality

The `script.js` file provides the necessary functionality for the Spotify Clone. It handles play/pause actions, updates the song progress bar, 
and allows users to skip to the next or previous song. The script also dynamically loads song details and covers from an array.

## Song Data

The array in the JavaScript file (`script.js`) contains information about various songs, including the song name, file path, and cover image path. 
This data is used to populate the song list and dynamically load song details during playback.

Feel free to explore, modify, and contribute to this Spotify Clone. If you have any suggestions or improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
Enjoy your virtual Spotify experience with the **Spotify Clone**!
